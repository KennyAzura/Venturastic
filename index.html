                                    marginalized communities who display determination, skills,
                                    imagination and understanding of what it takes to create change. Our program is designed to
                                    connect and cultivate a
                                    pipeline of entrepreneurs both Micro and Social who are committed to tackling poverty and
                                    injustice in their
                                    communities.<br><br>
                                    Patient capital is not a grant, it is an investment which is intended to recoup its principal.
                                    It would not seek to
                                    maximize financial returns on its investment, as we seek to maximize social impact, to
                                    capitalize the creation of
                                    markets to combat poverty and give an opportunity for growth to both Micro and Social
                                    enterprise.<br><br>
                                    With our patient capital program, we as the investor are willing to make a financial investment
                                    in a business with no
                                    expectation of turning a quick profit, instead investors will demand accountability in the form
                                    of return on capital and
                                    substantiated proof that the enterprise can grow sustainably in the long run. If we do have a
                                    very huge success story to
                                    share, we as a team would feel proud of being a part of that success.<br><br>
                                    Each year we aim to invest in 2 projects as a Patient Capital Investor and back these projects
                                    with our expertise,
                                    business advisory and strategic support, to ensure that they succeed and become
                                    self-sustainable.
